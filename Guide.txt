How to use me:

In terminal:
1. Run "make"
2. Run "./toCpp filePath"

PS. Non-default constructors do not convert correctly and overload as well as const hasn't been added yet

Important bugs to stay away from (I promise to fix them soon):

1. Make run with filename doesn't work
2. Running ./toCpp with no file results in a crash
3. Custom constructors do not convert correctly. 

@TODO:

1. Add overload functionality
2. Add custom constructor functionality
3. Add const functionality
